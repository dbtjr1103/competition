**Goal of the Competition**
The goal of this competition is to segment instances of microvascular structures, including capillaries, arterioles, and venules. You'll create a model trained on 2D PAS-stained histology images from healthy human kidney tissue slides.

Your help in automating the segmentation of microvasculature structures will improve researchers' understanding of how the blood vessels are arranged in human tissues.
